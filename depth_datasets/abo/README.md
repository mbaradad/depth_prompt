## Description

Amazon Berkeley Objects is a collection of 147,702 product listings with
multilingual metadata and 398,212 unique catalog images. 8,222 listings come
with turntable photography (also referred as *spin* or *360º-View* images), as
sequences of 24 or 72 images, for a total of 586,584 images in 8,209 unique
sequences. For 7,953 products, the collection also provides high-quality 3d
models, as glTF 2.0 files.

The collection is made of the following files:

  * `README.md` - The present file.

  * `LICENSE-CC-BY-NC-4.0.txt` - The License file. You must read, agree and
    comply to the License before using the Amazon Berkeley Objects data.

  * `listings/metadata/listings_<i>.json.gz` - Product description and metadata.
    Each of the 16 files is encoded with UTF-8 and gzip-compressed. Each line of
    the decompressed files corresponds to one product as a JSON object (see
    http://ndjson.org/ or https://jsonlines.org/ ). Each product JSON object

  * `images/metadata/images.csv.gz` - Image metadata. This file is a
    gzip-compressed comma-separated value (CSV) file with the following
    columns: `image_id`, `height`, `width`, and `path`.
    - `image_id` (string): this id uniquely refers to a product image. This id
      can be used to retrieve the image data from Amazon's Content Delivery
      Network (CDN) using the template:
      `https://m.media-amazon.com/image/I/<image_id>.<extension>` [^1],
      where `<extension>` is composed of the characters following the dot in the
      `path` field. Any value occurring in the `main_image` and `other_images`
      attributes of product metadata is an `image_id` present in this file.
    - `height` (int) and `width` (int): respectively, the height and width of
      the original image.
    - `path`: the location of the image file relative to the `images/original/`
      or `images/small/` directories. A path is composed of lowercase hex
      characters (`0-9a-f`) that also uniquely identifies images. The first two
      characters are used to build a file hierarchy and reduce the number of
      images in a single directory. The extension is `jpg` except for few `png`
      files.

  * `images/original/<path>` - Original image data. This directory contains the
     original high-resolution version of the images. See
     `images/metadata/images.csv.gz` for details of image naming.

  * `images/small/<path>` - Downscaled image data. This directory contains the
     version of the images, where they have been downscaled such that their
     largest axis (height or width) is a maximum of 256 pixels. See
     `images/metadata/images.csv.gz` for details of image naming.

  * `spins/metadata/spins.csv.gz` - Spin / 360º-View image metadata. This file
    is a gzip-compressed comma-separated value (CSV) file with the following
    fields: `spin_id`, `azimuth`, `image_id`, `height`, `width`, and `path`.
    - `spin_id`: a unique identifier for the image sequence.
    - `azimuth`: an integer between 0 and 71, representing the index in the spin
      sequence and the azimuth of the camera (in steps of 5º).
    - `image_id`: this id uniquely refers to an image. This is can be used
      to retrieve the image data using the template:
            `https://m.media-amazon.com/image/I/<image_id>.jpg` [^1].
    - `height` and `width`: respectively, the height and width of the image.
    - `path`: the location of the image file relative to the `spins/original/`
      directory. The extension is `jpg` for all the images. The `path` is build
      from the `spin_id` and `azimuth` using the template
      `<spin_id>_<azimuth:02d>.jpg` and the first two characters of `spin_id`
      are used to build a file hierarchy and reduce the number of files in a
      single directory.

  * `3dmodels/original/<path>` - 3d model files. The 3d models are provided in
    the [glTF-2.0 format](
    https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/master/specification/2.0/README.md
    ) (GLB/binary representation). All models adhere to the following
    conventions:
    1. Positive `Y` direction is up.
    2. Positive `Z` direction is pointing to the *natural* front-side of the
       product, wherever applicable.
    3. Products that are designed to stand on a surface (i.e. a floor) are
       centered on the origin, but translated up (towards positive `Y`) such
       that they *stand* on the `Y=0` plane.
    4. Products that are designed to hang from a surface (i.e. a ceiling) are
       centered on the origin, but translated down (towards negative `Y`) such
       that they *hang* from the `Y=0` plane.
    5. Products that are designed to hang on a wall are centered on the origin,
       but translated forward (towards positive `Z`) such that their backside
       aligns with the `Z=0` plane.
